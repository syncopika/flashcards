for the chinese flashcard option, I set added character recognition functionality to help make it easier to search the cards for a certain character. however, the accuracy may vary and so may not be super useful at the moment. Thanks very much to gugray's https://github.com/gugray/hanzi_lookup, which I used for this functionality.
